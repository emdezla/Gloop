# Model Readiness Report

## Training Summary
- Total Epochs: 150
- Final Critic Loss: 0.6318
- Final Actor Loss: 10.1665
- Final Entropy (alpha): 2.2531

## Readiness Checklist
- ✅ Critic loss stabilized for last 100 epochs (std=0.0740)
- ✅ alpha > 0.1 maintained in final 20% of training
- ✅ Action std between 0.2-0.6 (current=0.3478)
- ❌ Q-values within [-4.5, -0.5] range (Q1=-9.8595, Q2=-9.8600)
- ✅ <1% difference between final Q1/Q2 values (0.0046308211539661265%)

## Recommendations
- Adjust reward scaling or critic network architecture
